PR.js
=====

PR.js is an HTML5 canvas framework designed to resemble the [Processing](https://processing.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/processing/processing)) API.

A similar famous project is [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/processing/p5.js)), but my project is much smaller and simpler.
